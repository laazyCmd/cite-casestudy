## CITE Case Study
This was my group's project for our final term in Data Structures and Algorithm, improving upon on a [related project](https://github.com/laazyCmd/student-management-dashboard).

The main improvements were: an access view, login and creating new accounts, new sort by classification (all, student or teacher), new options for sorting by (first name, pre-order, post-order). Though, we removed the ability to create new entries in the dashboard view, because we felt it was unnecessary.
